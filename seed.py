Hull's maritime heritage dates back to Roman times and continues to evolve, with a fishing fleet, ferries, oil tankers and cargo ships docking regularly. A recently redeveloped marina and a stunning millenium building telling the story of the world's oceans, with the deepest acquarium tank in Europe, are both helping to put Hull on the tourist map. The three mile stretch of sand and shingle, known as Spurn Head, that leads to the mouth of the Humber estuary, is an important resting place for migratory birds. Hornsea and Withernsea are good shingle beaches north of Hull, with Withernsea stretching all the way to Bridlington, twenty miles further north. Just north of Bridlington is the spectacular Flamborough Head, a chalk headland that sticks out in proud contrast to the rugged shale cliffs either side.",
