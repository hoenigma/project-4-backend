A recently redeveloped marina and a stunning millenium building telling the story of the world's oceans, with the deepest acquarium tank in Europe, are both helping to put Hull on the tourist map. The three mile stretch of sand and shingle, known as Spurn Head, that leads to the mouth of the Humber estuary, is an important resting place for migratory birds. Hornsea and Withernsea are good shingle beaches north of Hull, with Withernsea stretching all the way to Bridlington, twenty miles further north.

John O'Groats is billed as the most northerly point on the British Isles, although the wilder and less commercial Dunnet Head contests this title. Dunnet Head lies between Thurso and Wick, the main settlements on the north shore. Both towns are folded around small harbours and still depend largely on fishing for their survival, although tourism plays an increasingly important role.
